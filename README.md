# Improved-ResNet-Action-Recognition-Skeletal-Data
This repository is an implementation of ["Exploiting deep residual networks for human action recognition from skeletal data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07781) by Huy-Hieu Pham, Louahdi  Khoudour, Alain Crouzil, Pablo Zegers, and Sergio A. Velastin. You can train deep Residual Networks on skeletal data for action recognition tasks from scratch.
